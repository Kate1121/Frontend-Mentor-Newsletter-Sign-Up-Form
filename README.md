A challenge that I faced while coding this project was enabling form submission while also displaying the success page until the user clicks on the dismiss button. 

Additionally, I struggled to utilize the flexbox layout to center the info and photo class sections so that they remained centered even when the screen size was decreased.

Nevertheless, utilizing the Chrome DevTools assisted me in overcoming these challenges.
